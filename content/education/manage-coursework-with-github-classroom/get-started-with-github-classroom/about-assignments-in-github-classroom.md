## About assignments in {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}

Assignments are coursework created for students in {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}. You can use assignments to test and grade your students, or to help your students practice their learnings.

With {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}, you can create individual assignments, to be completed by a single student, or group assignments, to be completed in teams. For more information, see "[Types of assignments](#types-of-assignments)."

When student(s) accept(s) an assignment - either individual or group -, GitHub Classroom automatically creates a new repository or adds them to a team in an existing repository. The repositories can be empty, or you can create the repositories from a template repository with starter code, documentation, tests, and other resources. Each assignment repository belongs to your organization account on {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}.

{% data reusables.classroom.about-assignments %}

Optionally, you can enable feedback pull requests on anv assignment. If you enable this feature for an assignment, {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} creates a special pull request titled **Feedback** in the assignment repository for each student or group. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/leave-feedback-with-pull-requests)."

If you integrate your {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} with an IDE, students can make changes to their assignment repositories through the IDE, or by checking out and running code locally with the appropriate software. For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide)."

You can reuse existing assignments in any other classroom you have admin access to, including classrooms in a different organization. For more information, see [AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/reuse-an-assignment)."

## Types of assignments 

You can create both individual assignments and group assignments with {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.

### Individual assignments

An individual assignment is coursework for each student who participates in a course on GitHub Classroom. The student is intended to complete an individual assignment without help from other students.

When a student accepts an assignment, GitHub Classroom automatically creates a new repository for the student. 

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-individual-assignment)."

### Group assignments

A group assignment is collaborative coursework for groups of students on GitHub Classroom. Students can work together on a group assignment in a shared repository, like a team of professional developers.

When a student accepts a group assignment, the student can create a new team or join an existing team. GitHub Classroom saves the teams for an assignment as a set. You can name the set of teams for a specific assignment when you create the assignment, and you can reuse that set of teams for a later assignment.

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-a-group-assignment)."
