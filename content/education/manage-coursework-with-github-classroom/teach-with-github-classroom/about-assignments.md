You can create both individual assignments and group assignments with {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %}.

### Individual assignments

{% data reusables.classroom.assignments-individual-definition %}

{% data reusables.classroom.classroom-creates-individual-repositories %}

For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/teach-with-github-classroom/create-an-individual-assignment)."

### Group assignments

{% data reusables.classroom.assignments-group-definition %} Students can work together on a group assignment in a shared repository, like a team of professional developers.

When a student accepts a group assignment, the student can create a new team or join an existing team. {% data variables.product.prodname_classroom %} saves the teams for an assignment as a set. You can name the set of teams for a specific assignment when you create the assignment, and you can reuse that set of teams for a later assignment.
